		<h2>HTML</h2>
		HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
		It is used to design web pages using a 
		markup language. HTML is a combination of 
		Hypertext and Markup language. 
		Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A
		markup language is used to define the text document 
		within the tag which defines the structure of web
		pages. This language is used to annotate 
		(make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can
		understand it and manipulate text accordingly.

		Every front-end developer and web developer knows how
